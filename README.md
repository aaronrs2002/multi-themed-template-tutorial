Try staying away from writing the same code over and over by consolidating clients into a single template. Each client gets their individual content, logos, fonts, color scheme etc. However, everything in managed in one spot. I walk through doing this locally. However, it could be done with an API as well.

Course Outline:
00:12 - Write HTML footer
02:03 - Using JavaScript for dynamic content (Building local json for data)
02:29 - Replace or escape any double quotes (Avoid broken strings)
07:10 - Test all screen sizes 
08:55 - Font update 
10:43 - Add another client's data
12:12 - Utilize the url parameters
15:18 - HTML data ID targets

This would be great for league sports where all teams get represented from the same site.
